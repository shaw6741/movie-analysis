There have yet to be any older films from the region discovered. This is the sole reason I decided to check this film out as the 1st of my 6 part Classic Korean Cinema Marathon. I went in with essentially no expectations, apart from seeing, again, the oldest surviving Korean film. I walked away not learning too much, nor was the film the greatest, but still, it was solid and very much watchable, even if only in the academic sense. \\r\\n\\r\\nSweet Dream is a simply told story of a bickering husband and wife, in which the wife, who is told she isn't a good housekeeper and housewife, decides to leave her husband and daughter behind in hopes to lead a better lifestyle for herself. She parts ways and hooks up with seemingly the first man she meets. Now I didn't quite catch if she knew this guy prior to us an audience member seeing him for the 1st time, but I think they are just total strangers that meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, the man she meets does indeed have one funky looking mustache. So much so, that I found myself studying it with every shot he was in. Joking aside, and getting back on track, essentially the film is just a melodrama with not very likable characters. I get it that the woman wanted the better life and maybe felt trapped, but the husband was in anyway evil or horrible enough to warrant the character's dream to escape. In fact, none of the characters are fleshed out, not even for the times of the cinema, so that was sort of a let down. I liked the character of the father, but mainly just because he wishes the little daughter wasn't so devastated by her mother's departure for the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot being able to see other films from this period in Korea, I have nothing to compare it to or with, so I will say it's decently made, but never excels past mediocrity. I just found myself enjoying the fact that I was even getting to watch the movie, and that itself is enough reason to wholeheartedly recommend this to any movie goer interested in Korean cinema or world cinema in general. This is as far as you can go back into Korea's film history for now, and it is a nice look back.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy biggest complaint with the entire thing was the ending. The mother's irrational thinking and the idiocy in the choices made left me sighing. I thought it was about to be a fantastic scene because the acting and editing, plus all the other elements were spot-on for this scene, then it just veered off into stupidity, and ultimately annoyed me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sound harsh towards this film, but after all is said in done, I liked it. I most certainly didn't love it, and I may not see it again for a very long time, but it is certainly a film worth seeing, even if only for a good trip back in history, to a time where Korean films weren't booming internationally. This was before they put themselves big on the map, and long before at that. It's a wonder to see this film looking as nicely as it does (and it looks pretty rough in spots).\\r\\n\\r\\nI guess in a sentence, which may make this entire review pointless, is that this movie is a prototype and trendsetter for the darkness that kind of embodies itself into Korean films and dramas still to this day. It's not a bad thing, it's actually a good thing. It's nice to not have a pretty sunshine ending all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n3/5.\"},\n"," {'rating': '4',\n","  'date': '11 Oct 2016',\n","  'review_link': '/joe_palmer/film/sweet-dream/',\n","  'content': '\"When Yang Ju Nam’s Sweet Dream was found in a Chinese cinema in 2006, it was thought to be the oldest surviving Korean film. This title was eventually taken by Cheongchun’s Sipjaro, a silent film released two years prior to 1936’s Sweet Dream. Sweet Dream does however, remain the oldest sound film in Korea that still exists in some format. It is special for this reason, as it represents a period of Korean cinema that is almost completely unknown to us today. The Korean Film Archive believes that between 1910 and 1940 approximately 140 films were produced, of which only five are available. Sweet Dream is then imperative for those of us who are trying to come to some understanding of Korean film history. It offers a snippet of what life might have been like under Japanese rule and technically shows us that film language still had a long way to come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Review here: http://kultscene.com/reviewing-the-korean-film-archive-sweet-dream/'},\n"," {'rating': '6',\n","  'date': '',\n","  'review_link': '/obligatory/film/sweet-dream/',\n","  'content': \"Sweet Dream is stunning.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, it comes close to other auteurs of the early years of cinema, namely August Blom or Jean Vigo, taking the camera in strange places, with beautiful mood matching motifs and brilliant techniques, daring experimentation to go along with it. The way the hallway is filmed makes running feel more like falling, trains and cars are handled intensely, while still rooms are given a level of patience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film deals with questionable characters and questionable decisions, with the biggest source of innocence, the daughter, having her arc concluded with the decisions of her mother crashing down onto her in a heartbreaking final scene, with some of the most poignant and lonely shots of the film (even in a room full of people). Sweet Dream doesn't stray away from tragedy, or act like these types of stories deserve a resolution. There's no resolution to a story like this, and it ends at its bleakest. For a film in 1936 to do this, so quietly and painfully, is stellar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these moments are kept at a reasonable length of only fifty minutes, even offering occasional moments of rest for the viewer, such as a beautifully filmed dance sequence that acts as the calm before the storm of the film, at least that's how I perceive it. It's a haunting film, largely because of how it never overstates itself. It rolls by, not a second wasted, and never forcing more than it can. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor director Ju-nam Yang to create something like this at the time he did is remarkable, and shows he was a real force in Korean cinema at the time, at least stylistically.
